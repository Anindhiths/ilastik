Building your own applet: appletExample
================================================================================

Basic Structure
========================================

A good example of a basic applet could watershedSegmentation, that is based on the wsdti applet.

Then create a folder in 
ilastik/applets/
with the name appletExample:
In this directory there are 5 files:
#. __init__.py
.. literalinclude:: ../ilastik/applets/appletExample/__init__.py
    :linenos:
    :language: python
#. appletExampleApplet.py
   * for initialization
   * for communication with workflow (e.g. with slotbroadcasting)
#. appletExampleGui.py
   * handles the graphical user interface and the slots, that are 
   * handles the views of the layer
#. appletExampleSerializer.py
   include here all the slots used in before, that can be used in the applet
#. opAppletExample.py
   * The algorithms are executed here
   




The lines marked with TODO should be replaced for a new applet.
There you can include the desired applets.

For an additional widget that shall be seen for this specific applet, 
you can use the following files in volumina/volumina/widgets:

TODO create these two files

#. appletExampleWidget.py
#. ui/appletExampleWidget.ui
